See you in court: election aftermath（后果）

Donald Trump has just become the first American president-elect (总统选举)to lack any political or military experience. Later this month he will mark another first: defending himself before a jury in federal civil court against allegations of fraud and racketeering. The complaints stem from his Trump University real-estate seminars, which the plaintiffs allege violated consumer-fraud statutes in California, Florida and New York. He faces other legal wrangles too. New York’s attorney-general is looking into his charitable foundation. Mr Trump is suing two celebrity chefs who cancelled plans to open restaurants in his Washington hotel, and has threatened to sue several women who accused him of sexual impropriety. His campaign manager says he has not ruled out appointing a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server while secretary of state—even though the FBI has already declined to charge her.
