Stand and Deliver: Delivery Hero's IPO

Shares in the meals-delivery firm begin trading in Frankfurt today after an initial public offering raised an estimated €1bn ($1.14bn) this week, valuing it above €4bn. The Berlin-based firm dominates the German market, matching restaurants and home diners, and is present—often as the local leader—in over 40 countries. Dominance matters: the business is reckoned to be winner-takes-all and consumers are likely to have only one meals app on their phones. Similar firms, such as Grubhub in America and Just Eat in Britain, have done well since their own IPOs, though giants like Amazon and Uber are starting to muscle in. The share offering is a good result for Delivery Hero's part-owner, Rocket Internet, which builds companies that mimic successes elsewhere. Berlin's emerging tech scene will be even better served if venture capitalists now enjoying a payday find truly original startups, not only me-too companies, to fund next.
