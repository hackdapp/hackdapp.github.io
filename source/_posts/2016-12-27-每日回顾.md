## Kit off: sexualising men on screen  
> sexualising 性化

① Male actors have been complaining of increased objectification by female fans.
> objectification 物质化

② Kit Harington, a star of “Game of Thrones”, says it is “demeaning” that he is “put on a pedestal as a hunk”.  
> demeaning 有损人格  
> be put on … As …  被架在。。。

③ Henry Cavill, the current big-screen incarnation of Superman, complains of a “double standard”.
> 

④ They may have a point.
```
他们是对的
```
⑤ A study by USC Annenberg finds that the “hyper-sexualisation” of men in films has increased in recent years.
> hyper-sexualisation 过渡性化

⑥ Of the 100 top-grossing films at the American box-office in 2007, 4.6% of male characters were seen in “sexualised attire” and 6.6% “with some nudity”.
```
```
> top-grossing 票房总额

⑦ In 2014 those figures `stood at` 8.0% and 9.1%. 

⑧ 2013 marked the highest point of this trend, with 9.7% of male characters in sexually alluring clothing, and 11.7% taking some (or all) of their kit off.

⑨ Even so, women are still three times more likely to be objectified on screen than men—and get fewer speaking roles.
