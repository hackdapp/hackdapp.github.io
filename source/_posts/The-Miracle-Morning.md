### The Miracle Morning by Hal Elrod 

Summary by [Niklas Goeke](http://niklasgoeke.com/)

After being in a car crash and declared clinically dead for 6 minutes, Hal Elrod spent 6 weeks in a coma, before he wake up. The doctors told him he would never walk again.

After contemplating and lamenting his misery for 5 minutes, he said: “Can’t change it”, accepted his new situation and moved on with his life. This is what he calls the 5 minute rule.

Studies have shown that if you follow 100 Americans from the beginning of their working life until 40 years later, 1 will have become wealth, 4 financially stable, 5 have to keep working through retirement, 36 have died and 54 rely on financial help from friends and family. That means 95% never live up to their potential.

2 reasons for not living up to your potential can be Rear View Mirror Syndrome and Isolating Incidences.

RMS means you limit yourself, your choices and decisions, by always living in the troubles of the past. For example you could think: “I’ve screwed up all my former relationships, I’m sure this one won’t work out either.” Of course it won’t, if you go in with this attitude.Isolating Incidences means that you treat the events in your life as singular. “It’s no biggie if I skip working out today, I can always go tomorrow.” But as T. Harv Eker says “How you do anything is how you do everything.” These little exceptions will become the norm, because with such slacker decisions you affect not only today, but also who you become. Your life is the sum of your habits, actions and its many other parts. It all matters equally.Isolating Incidences means that you treat the events in your life as singular. “It’s no biggie if I skip working out today, I can always go tomorrow.” But as T.

Your life is the sum of your habits, actions and its many other parts. It all matters equally.Don’t ruin your day if you had a bad night’s sleep by saying: “This is way too little, I can’t function this way, the day’s ruined.” Tell yourself that you’ll feel good and make the most of the day instead, you’ll survive the day just fine!

The goal of a good morning routine is to increase your “Wake up motivation level”. It means on a scale of 1 to 10 you move up, where 10 is being super excited to start the day, whereas 1 means wanting to stay in bed at all costs.

Start by telling yourself that you’ll have a good night’s sleep and wake up refreshed in the morning, regardless of when you go to bed. Place your alarm at the other end of your room if you need to use one. Once you wake up, immediately rise and brush your teeth. This is the first step to feeling fresh. Then have a glass of water right afterwards.

**Afterwards, you can start the 6­step Miracle Morning:**

### **Silence**
Practice purposeful silence in the form of meditation ­ sit cross­legged and upright where you’re comfortable (on the couch, on the floor, on your bed, wherever). Focus all your attention on your breath, breathe deeply and slowly. Inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth. Don’t breath into your chest, but your stomach instead. Then set a rhythm for your breathing. 3 seconds in, 3 seconds out. Do this for 10 minutes. If you find meditation doesn’t work for you, maybe pray, think about things you are grateful for, or find other ways to relax.

### **Affirmations**
Practice purposeful silence in the form of meditation ­ sit cross­legged and upright where you’re comfortable (on the couch, on the floor, on your bed, wherever). Focus all your attention on your breath, breathe deeply and slowly. Inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth. Don’t breath into your chest, but your stomach instead. Then set a rhythm for your breathing. 3 seconds in, 3 seconds out. Do this for 10 minutes.

### **Exercise**

Focus all your attention on your breath, breathe deeply and slowly. Inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth. Don’t breath into your chest, but your stomach instead.

If you find meditation doesn’t work for you, maybe pray, think about things you are grateful for, or find other ways to relax.

### **Read**
Reading and writing helps your personal growth. Try reading 10 pages each morning. Imagine doing this for one year. You’d have read 3650 pages, or roughly 18 books! With only 10 pages! That is a huge change, fueled by a small commitment. Feel free to re­read, highlight and circle information to get your brain up and running.

### **Writing/Scribing**Take a few minutes to write down your thoughts, feelings and insights. You will always learn something. Hal split a page into two sections: Lessons Learned and New Commitments. This helped him focus on what he had already achieved and where he needed to improve, leaving him much more grateful for where he was at on each given day.**SAVERS ­an acronym to remember the 6 steps by**----
Customize your Miracle Morning! You can take an hour and divide it up however you like. For example you could spend 30 minutes exercising, and then only 5 minutes on the other 5 things. If you’re pressed for time you can even do the entire routine in 6 minutes! Do a 1­minute meditation, recite your affirmations, picture your day for 1 minute, do 1 set of an exercise like pushups or jumping jacks, read one page in a book and write down 3 things you are grateful for.
You can also do this wherever you are, since you don’t need a lot of equipment or gear with you, you can just take a pen, a piece of paper and a book and are good to go!
They key point is to have a dedicated time for self­improvement each day.**`Challenge`**
Seek an accountability partner to help you make the Miracle Morning stick. When you have a workout buddy who you go to the gym with, you’re much more likely to follow through. So get a friend and commit to each other that you’ll do 30 days of the Miracle Morning and see how it works out for you.
You’ll notice 3 phases: the first 10 days it’s hard and you have to fight each day not to give up. The second 10 days it will start to feel more normal. The last 10 days your Miracle Morning will already become enjoyable, and you will look forward to it each day.
